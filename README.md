# Deploying-Shiny-Apps-to-Heroku-with-Docker-From-the-Command-Line

Heroku is a cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that lets you deploy, run and manage applications. Heroku is also part of the Salesforce Platform, enabling enterprises to store and leverage customer data in Salesforce for full-cycle CRM engagement.

An application (app) is the combination of its source code and the dependency description that determines how to build and run the application. The build mechanism is typically language-specific and is based on so-called Buildpacks.

Heroku is really a no-hassle solution for hosting web applications, including dockerized Shiny apps. Using Docker makes it easy to rely on an already familiar workflow with very minimal modifications. The Heroku CLI is a powerful declarative tool that plays nicely with your git-based workflow.
